# Flutter MVVM GetX Project

A modern Flutter application implementing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern using GetX state management solution. This project serves as a template for building scalable and maintainable Flutter applications.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of MVVM architecture in Flutter using GetX for:
- State Management
- Dependency Injection
- Route Management
- API Integration

## Architecture

The project follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

- **Model**: Data and business logic layer
- **View**: UI layer (Widgets)
- **ViewModel**: Mediator between Model and View, handling UI logic and state management

## Features

- MVVM Architecture Implementation
- GetX State Management
- HTTP API Integration
- Local Storage with SharedPreferences
- Asset Management (Images and Icons)
- Material Design Implementation
